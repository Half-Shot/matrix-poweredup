# matrix-poweredup

This application bridges a [node-poweredup](https://github.com/nathankellenicki/node-poweredup) LEGO device
with [Matrix](https://matrix.org). It's currently extremely barebones but works for the purposes of the demo.

This app contains both a backend bot application and a web frontend.
